    <h1>About DremJS</h1>
    <h2>Version: 0.1.2b</h2>
    <h2>Agenda WM 0.0.1b</h2>
    <p>Note: If something isn't right with your desktop, try reloading the frame! If that doesn't work, clear your browsers cache!</p>
    <p>Another Note: When loading an app or clicking the Start button, flickering is normal. This is just because the IFrame is loading the application.</p>
    <p>Changelog:</p>
    <p>Version 0.1.2b</p>
    <p>This is a very important and large release for DremJS!</p>
    <p>We are going to hard code the start menu to stay open at all times for a while until we care enough to reimpliment it better.</p>
    <!--  Maybe in 0.1.3b... -->
    <!--<p>+++We're very glad to present a very basic application installation program! It only works on MiniWeb. I don't know if it will work on Apache servers or not.</p>-->
    <p>+++With the brand new Agenda WM, you can now multitask in DremJS!</p>
    <p>+Added 'cmd_fm' command to terminal. CMD.FM is a free online radio service that looks like a computer terminal.</p> 
    <p>Version 0.1.1b</p>
    <p>+A terminal that is accessable from the Debug Menu. It's based off of <a href="https://codepen.io/AndrewBarfield/pen/qEqWMq?css-preprocessor=scss">Andrew Barfield's HTML5 Web Terminal</a>.</p>
    <p>~Some UI Tweaks</p>
    <p>~Bug Fixes</p>
    <p>~Made the shutdown function actually shut DremJS down</p>
    <p>Version 0.1.0b</p>
    <p>+A taskbar</p>
    <p>++Home button moved to taskbar</p>
    <p>++About app is on taskbar for defaults. Because we are still working on the taskbar, documentation for adding or removing icons from the taskbar will not be released yet.</p>
    <p>~Some apps moved to the Marketplace to make DremJS smaller. The most important apps stay (About, DremJS Market, How to Install Apps, Report a Bug)</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.9-1a</p>
    <p>+PVT Counter</p>
    <p>~Improved 404 screen that isn't an eye sore when you look at it in the dark</p>
    <p>~Bug Fixes</p>
    <p>~Made the GUI more centered and prettier</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.8-2a</p>
    <p>=More WAV to MP3 fixes</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.8-1a</p>
    <p>+A crash handler for 404 errors, should you have any.</p>
    <p>+A little debug menu that can be found in the bug report application. Uncommenting it will enable it. At the moment, it is mostly useless.</p>
    <p>~A few minor patches</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.8a</p>
    <p>+Shutdown animation</p>
    <p>+Added icons for downloadable apps (apps in DremJS Market)</p>
    <p>=Better Shop app (no iframe inside an iframe)</p>
    <p>=Better way of getting downloads from DremJS Market (GitHub Releases)</p>
    <p>=To prevent having to resize div in index-open.html, the start menu takes up the entire left hand side of the open page</p>
    <p>=SO MANY MORE BUG FIXES!!!</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.7-3a</p>
    <p>Removed the underlines and made all application links black in the start menu.</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.7-2a</p>
    <p>Ironically, fixed a bug in the debug application which caused DremJS to open in a new tab when clicking "Go Back" by simply removing it. That's the home button's job anyway!</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.7-1a</p>
    <p>~Compatibility Update</p>
    <p>Tured some .wav files into mp3 files for consistancy, and for better support for MiniWeb</p>
    <p>Made the Debug application an application with the purpose of bug reporting</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.7a</p>
    <p>~Compatibility Update</p>
    <p>+Changed iframes to use %'s rather than px. This will make the OS grow or shrink per the device's size. This was mainly added for smaller devices such as phones and tablets.</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.6-1a</p>
    <p>+Open menu sound added</p>
    <p>+Ambient music added in some built in applications</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.6a</p>
    <p>This update was really only made for fun and to make the OS overall prettier.</p>
    <p>~The Market got moved to the actual DremJS-Market repository so that everyone has the same DremJS Market</p>
    <p>+App Icons!</p>
    <p>+Favicon!</p>
    <p>+Shutdown Button</p>
    <p>+Shutdown Sound</p>
    <p>+Startup Sound</p>
    <p>+A few more small tweaks to make the OS prettier</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.5a</p>
    <p>+Whats that?! It's a gradualy improving app store!! You must download DremJS and host it or run it on your browser on your own PC to use it though.</p>
    <p>Installation instructions are inside the zip that will download from it. Read it before you install!!!</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.4a</p>
    <p>+Sam&Yoe Group: The Video Game</p>
    <p>  ~Music has some problems</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.3a</p>
    <p>Now for some functionality.</p>
    <p>+TinyMCE Text Editor</p>
    <p>+Paint app</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.2a</p>
    <p>+This version actually used javascript for the home button! Now DremJS really is DremJS! Seriously though, when installing web apps on this thing that don't have a home button, this button is a life saver.</p>
    <p>-All built-in apps have gotten their home buttons removed due to the "master" home button.</p>
    <p>-Test Apps Removed (from start menu)</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.1a</p>
    <p>The first ever version. Doesn't even have JS yet, despite the name. Don't expect much.</p>
    <p>Future ideas:</p>
    <p>To be able to go back to the home screen easier, I will soon add a home button by loading apps using iframe instead.</p>
